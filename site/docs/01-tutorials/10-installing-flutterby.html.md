# Installing Flutterby

Flutterby is distributed as a RubyGem, so you can simply install it like any other gem:

~~~ bash
gem install flutterby
~~~

Please note that **Flutterby requires at least Ruby 2.2**, so please make sure you're running this or a newer version.

**If you're on macOS:** unfortunately, the latest version of macOS only comes with Ruby 2.0 pre-installed (which is no longer being maintained.) The easiest (and recommended) way of getting a recent version of Ruby on macOS is to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and invoke `brew install ruby`.
