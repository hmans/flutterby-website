# What is Flutterby?

<div class="intro" markdown="1">
Flutterby is a tool for web developers who want to **rapidly develop websites and web-based applications**. You can use it for anything from simple, static websites, blogs and portfolios, to complex content-driven websites and applications.

You can use Flutterby as a **static site generator**, with the occasional dash of Ruby to customize the generated output. But once your website requires it, Flutterby can also serve it in **live mode**, turning it into a **fully dynamic, server-rendered web application**. No need to migrate your project to another framework!
</div>


#### Core Features

- Compiles your website project to a **static site** that you can simply upload to your server for easy deployment.

- Alternatively, runs your site in **Live Mode** on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or your own server. _TODO: add link to Live Mode guide._

- Supports a **high number of template engines and languages**, including ERB, Haml, Slim, Sass, CoffeeScript and many more. If something is missing, it's trivial to add support for it!

- Supports **Ruby-powered [templates](/docs/the-basics/dynamically-rendered-files.html) and [layouts](/docs/the-basics/layouts.html)** for rendering or further customizing your site.

- Flutterby is **data-aware**; you can query the contents of JSON, YAML etc. files, render them to HTML, and more. _TODO: add link to data file tutorial_

- Use **any structure you like**; Flutterby sees your website just like you do: as a tree of files. _TODO: link to site tree introduction._
