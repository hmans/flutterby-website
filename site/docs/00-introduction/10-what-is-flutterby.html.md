# What is Flutterby?

Flutterby is a tool that enables **rapid development of websites and web-based applications**. It can be used to generate a **static version of your site** (for easy deployment), but it can also serve a **live version** once static serving no longer suffices.

Flutterby allows you to **start simple** and grow your site step by step, without the need to switch to another framework once your site reaches a certain complexity.


#### Flutterby is a website compiler

Flutterby will read a source directory of files and use the very same structure when exporting your site. It will **render Markdown files to HTML** just as happily as it will **compile your frontend assets** -- you don't need to set up an additional JavaScript asset compilation pipeline (but if that is what you want, we won't stop you.)


#### Flutterby is powered by Ruby

Fluttery is **developed in Ruby**, and uses this to maximum effect. You can use Ruby-enhanced templates, add new view helper methods, or even create initializers that modify your site or its structure before being exported.

#### Flutterby is crazy insane

The way you build websites with Flutterby is radically different from what you may be used to from other static site generators or application frameworks.
