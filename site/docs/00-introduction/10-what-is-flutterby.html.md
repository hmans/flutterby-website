# What is Flutterby?

Flutterby is a tool for web developers who want to **rapidly develop websites and web-based applications**. You can use it for anything from simple, static websites, blogs and portfolios, to complex content-driven websites and applications.

Flutterby can be used as a **static site generator** for easy deployment of your website, but it can also serve a **live version** once the need arises.

It will happily render HTML from many supported input formats, pre-processes your CSS, bundle your JavaScript, and can be further enhanced with dashes of Ruby code.

Flutterby allows you to **start simple** and grow your site step by step, without the need to switch to another framework once your site reaches a certain complexity.


#### Flutterby is a website compiler

Unlike other tools of its kind, Flutterby imposes no specific structure on your project -- it will simply read a source directory of files and export your website using the very same structure. You can have **Markdown files** that render to HTML just as well as **pure data files** that you can process further. And of course Flutterby will also happily compile all your frontend assets without the need for a separate JavaScript-based build pipeline. (But you can use one if that's your cup of tea.)


#### Flutterby is powered by Ruby

Fluttery is **developed in Ruby**, and uses this to maximum effect. You can use Ruby-enhanced templates, add new view helper methods, or even create initializers that modify your site or its structure before being exported.

#### Flutterby is crazy insane

The way you build websites with Flutterby is radically different from what you may be used to from other static site generators or application frameworks.
