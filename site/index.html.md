# Flutterby

The flutterrific **static site generation** toolkit. Use **Markdown**, **Sass**, **Slim**, and many more! Add **JSON**, **YAML** or **TOML** data files and render them to HTML! Add a **dash of Ruby** here and there, or go **full-on crazy** with it! [That sounds incredible, show me the docs](/docs/)!

#### For the impatient:

~~~ bash
# Install the gem. Ruby 2.2+ required!
gem install flutterby

# Create a new project.
flutterby new myblog
cd myblog

# Behold your new website on localhost:4004
bin/flutterby serve

# ...or build a static copy that you
# can upload to your server:
bin/flutterby build
~~~
